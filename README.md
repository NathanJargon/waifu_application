To assist myself in creating a neat, user-friendly food delivery app that runs on both Android and iOS, I created the food delivery app UI Kit. This kit includes 25 exquisitely created screens and a generous helping of delectably responsive components. It also have skeleton loading and separate components for both Android and iOS. 

THANK YOU FOR VISITING!
